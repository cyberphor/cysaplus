# Introduction

Hello world! My name is Victor Fernandez III. These are notes I have developed to help you prepare for the CompTIA Cybersecurity Analyst \(CySA+\) certification. They also represent what I believe should be the baseline body of knowledge for _advanced_ cybersecurity professionals. Based on my experience in the field, I strongly recommend either passing the CompTIA Security+ certification exam first or getting comfortable with basic cybersecurity knowledge before going further. If this recommendation speaks to you, I have a [digital notebook](https://securityplus.cyberphor.com/) for the CompTIA Security+ certification to help get you started.
